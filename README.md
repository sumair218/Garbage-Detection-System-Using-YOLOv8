This project implements a YOLO-based object detection model for identifying and classifying various types of garbage. The system is designed to detect recyclable and non-recyclable waste in real-time, aiding in efficient waste management. The key features include:

High accuracy in detecting multiple garbage categories.
Optimized for edge devices to ensure real-time performance.
Dataset preparation, annotation, model training, and evaluation.
Comprehensive documentation for replicability and deployment.
Technologies Used: Python, YOLO, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV.

Applications:

Automated waste segregation.
Environmental monitoring and cleanliness drives.
